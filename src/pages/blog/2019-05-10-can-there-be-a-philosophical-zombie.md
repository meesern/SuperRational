In a thought experiment put forward by David Chalmers, Robert Kirk, Karlyn Campbell and others is proposed a being indistinguishable from a person but possessing no internal experience - no consciousness.  In other words, a Philosophical Zombie.   The question asked is "is such a thing possible?"  Could, hypothetically there be an object that appeared human but had no internal consciousness, no experience.  Such an object could be poked with a stick and would respond with the range of responses we would expect from a person but would feel no pain.  One could have a conversation with a philosophical zombie (p-zombie) about without guessing the strange internal lack.  Is such a thing conceivable.

The debate has been wide ranging among contemporary philosophers but here are some thoughts from a metaphor-centric perspective.

The first thing is to unpack the word "indistinguishable" in the definition.  It is almost certain (with a caveat to come later) that given sufficient constraints in the context we can already create such a thing.  For example if interaction with the p-zombie is constrained to be through an email game of naughts and crosses (tic tac toe) such that all that can be seen are the proposed moves, then the problem of creating a p-zombie indistinguishable from a human is quite easy.  This is a trivial example of constraining the interaction but it can go further.  Alan Turing when he proposed the famous Turing Test imagined a person separated from the test subject (machine or person) and connected only via a teletype terminal.    With this constraint and some others (such as the amount of time to spend, the subjects that can be addressed etc.) modern (2019) AI can comfortably pass the test by fooling someone into thinking it is human.  The march towards expanding the constraints will inevitably continue...
