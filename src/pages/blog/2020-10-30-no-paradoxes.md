description: 'The universe does not suffer paradoxes'

One of the powers that we get from understanding we cannot know what the world is but only what the world is _like_, is the resolution of paradox.  The world itself does not and cannot suffer any paradox.  The stuff of the world has never cared if subatomic entities are waves or particles.  Underlying reality just gets on with itself.  The only way for a paradox to exist is in the minds of those attempting to understand the world, which we do, inevitably and necessarily, by creating metaphors (models) of the phenomenon under question.  And the only way that a paradox can be truly puzzling is by conflating the metaphor with underlying reality - by believing in the construction. 

The Oxford English dictionary defines a paradox as "An argument, based on (apparently) acceptable premises and using (apparently) valid reasoning, which leads to a conclusion that is against sense, logically unacceptable, or self-contradictory".  In other words a paradox is a situation which must at once be true and not true.  They are interesting for revealing boundaries in the fit of our metaphors.  They show up where reality curves one way and our models of reality curve another.

Here are a couple of classical examples.

### Zeno's paradox
### The paradox of the raven
