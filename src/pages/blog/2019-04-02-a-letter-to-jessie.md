  I held you when you were born and looked into your beautiful blue eyes as they
  first saw the world.  Now, many years later you are at university studying
  that same world through the eyes of the Mathematics and Philosophy
  curriculum.   Jessie, this is a good time for you to think more deeply about
  the world.

  From when I was a boy I studied the way the world worked.  I was a scientist, and I delighted in experiments that revealed the structure of the world – I had wonderful text-books and an enthusiastic and helpful father who sourced materials to make all sorts of exploratory devices: the electromagnets; the gold leaf electroscopes; the fractional distillation chamber.  I understood the motions of the earth, and the interactions of chemistry and the laws of physics.  I learned the history of science and the step by difficult step of the progress of mankind through the rationality and ingenuity of the world's greatest thinkers.  But I also had a mother who understood the passing of the seasons and could hear the call of the birds.  

Jessie, you are going to learn some amazing things at university, but there is more to learn.   Established ways of thinking are missing great chunks of truth about the world.  Mystics have been saying as much for a long time, but I don't mean in a mystical way – except, perhaps, that to some extent I do.  Rather I mean it in a solid, down to earth rational way.  What I do mean is that most standard accounts of rationality are flawed.  My darling daughter, in these last ten years of mine I have been on a very long journey and I have gathered some answers, and some remarkable questions.  I want to share them with you now, they will help you make sense of your studies, they will help you in your life and they will change the way you understand the world.  As you will see, it takes a particular state of mind to reach a new understanding.  I hope you are going to enjoy the journey.  It might take some little attention, but take heart that it should be easier going that much of the philosophy that you will shortly be reading, and is every bit as valuable for organising your understanding of the world.  

One thing I would say, Jessie, is take it slowly.  I am not skilled enough to write a text from which the ideas flow like spring streams.
I have to write this blog for you because the structures in my head need to get out somehow.  If I didn't they would turn up again elsewhere of course, sometime and somewhere, but at this point time tools to bring trust and understanding seem important.   If this blog is about one thing it is that 'knowing the world' is not independent of being a biological being within that same world.  As an idea this is not new.  It was understood by many thinkers including Alfred Korzybski when he developed General Semantics in the 1930's, and probably most notably by Gregory Bateson when he laid out the principles of second order cybernetics in the 1960's and 70's.  It was understood by Edmund Husserl when he created the field of phenomenology at the beginning of the 20th century, and by mystics and less technological cultures all over the world and all through time. 

 What I think is new is that if you start in just the right place, this understanding can all be drawn together along with natural science, art, religion, politics and health so that all of the world makes sense together.

You could ask what's important about the world making sense?  What's wrong with the way things are now where the science mindset tends to the superior and self-congratulatory, politicians' sophistry bullies and cajoles, marketeers exploit any chink they can find in the human psyche, the religious of all kinds defend themselves vehemently against reason while liberals insist on everyone's right to believe whatever they want.  All this while the population suffers from stress, depression, obesity and heart disease? 

 Well, in one sense, there is nothing wrong with that.  The world gets on pretty well no matter what we humans believe and I cannot change all or any of those ills.  But understanding how the world works can make you, Jessie my love, less susceptible to any of them.  It can make you more rational without losing compassion, empathy or access to the world's mysteries;  it can make you at home in the reality of the world around you without fatalism or cynicism.

So if you are ready let us start with truth...
